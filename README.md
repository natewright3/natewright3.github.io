Building off of my business card project, I used a similar color scheme and font choice to start building a personal brand for myself. I made use of CSS Grid for both my home page and subpages to allow for organized and responsive images and text. I incorporated different animations through CSS with 'hue-rotate' and in JavaScript with the 'animate.css' library, both used to make my logo stand out against the rest of the page's elements. I did this because I wanted to make sure to include more non-adjacent colors on  my site from feedback on how I should try to include more diverse ranges of color in my color schemes. Revisions I made based on other feedback was adding a photo of myself to my 'About' page, and making adjustments to the text I had on that page. With the additions and changes made to my 'About' pgae, I now have a layout to also use for the rest of my project subpages to make my workflow much smoother.
